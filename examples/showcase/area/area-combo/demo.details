 name: Area Chart Combination
 description: Because each kind of Forio Contour visualization is simply added to your Contour instance, it's easy to combine multiple types of charts and make single, coherent set of visualizations that are rendered together. Here, we increase the readibility of our basic area chart by adding a line chart as well.
