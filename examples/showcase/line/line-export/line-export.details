 name: Line Chart with Custom Marker
 description: In Narwhal, it's easy to create your own visualizations and add them to the core Narwhal object. Use the `export()` function to create the new kind of visualization. Then, add this new visualization to an instance of Narwhal. Here we've created a custom visualization that adds a horizontal line to the line chart, helping users to see how the data compare.
